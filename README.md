Welcome to my GitHub profile, 

I am a 26 year-old software developer living in Cluj-Napoca. Since I remember of my first experience, I have been a big fan of technology, and I try to keep up with all the news of its. The most groundbreaking experience of my life with coding was when I was 12 years old. I got my first professional full-time job as a software developer in 2017.

I have constantly been trying to improve my skills and I donâ€™t hesitate when I realize that there is still a lot to learn, so I am always open to new challenges.

I decided to share some of my ideas and attempts hoping that some of them can be helpful for someone. I hope you will find them beneficial and interesting, meanwhile I keep working to have as many relevant repositories and contributions as possible.

Please feel free to do code reviews and pull requests!

Catch me on the flip side.
